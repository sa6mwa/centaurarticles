# The Software Engineer Centaur

This repository is a working notebook for essays about human–AI collaboration in software creation. The name references the “centaur” metaphor that emerged after Garry Kasparov’s 1997 match against IBM’s Deep Blue: Kasparov noted that the strongest chess force is a human–computer pair, where the human provides judgment, strategic direction, intuition, and creativity, while the computer contributes exhaustive calculation, perfect tactics, and objective evaluation. The combination is stronger than either part alone. That framing—and Ben Shneiderman’s 2020 discussion of human-centered AI partnerships—serves as creative inspiration. The repository documents practical experience, research synthesis, and governance patterns for developers who rely on AI copilots, autonomous agents, and sociotechnical automation.

Expect recurring themes such as:

- Structured models for aligning methodologies (Agile, DevOps, Lean) with AI-accelerated workflows
- Case studies showing what single developers can build with agentic assistance
- Reflections on sociotechnical design, safety, and governance for human-in-the-loop systems

| [10x: Outcome-Based Agile in the Era of Human–AI Software Development](10x.pdf) | Evaluates how the Outcome-Based Agile Framework (OBAF) fits AI-accelerated iteration. Includes the [`lockd`](https://github.com/sa6mwa/lockd) case study and a six-dimensional compatibility model comparing OBAF with Scrum, SAFe, XP, Kanban, Lean Startup, and Waterfall. |
